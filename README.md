# Real Estate AVM

## Project Overview

Our project focuses on developing an Automated Valuation Model (AVM) that utilizes machine learning to enhance real estate price predictions. By combining property images processed through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with structured data using contrastive learning, our model creates a comprehensive representation of each property. An attention mechanism is used to dynamically identify and adjust prices based on the most relevant comparable properties. Initially trained on a dataset from the Zillow API, the modelâ€™s effectiveness will be measured against a baseline using key performance metrics (MSE and R^2), aiming to provide a fast, accurate, and automated tool for real estate investors.
