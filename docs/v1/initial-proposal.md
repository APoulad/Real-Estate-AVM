## Initial Project Proposal: Adaptive Real Estate AVM Using Embeddings and Dynamic Comparables

### Introduction:

Real estate investors rely heavily on accurate pricing predictions when considering a property for a potential investment. In order to make these estimates, investors analyze various sources of data including structured property data, images, and comparable sales (comps) to provide a holistic view of the target investment. With hundreds to thousands of properties in any given market, manually identifying great investment becomes an inefficient process and results in many missed opportunities due to fast-moving markets. Our goal is to develop a more efficient Automated Valuation Model (AVM) that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to accurately predict property prices. By identifying and adjusting for the most relevant comps, our system will help investors save time and make better data-driven decisions.

We propose an AVM that integrates both visual and structured data using advanced ML techniques. The model begins with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract key visual features from property images, such as condition, style, and quality. These visual features are combined with structured data (e.g., location, size, amenities) using contrastive learning to create a unified embedding space that represents each property. An attention mechanism is then used to dynamically select and prioritize the most relevant recently sold properties as comps.

After identifying a baseline price from the comps, the model adjusts this price to account for specific differences between the comps and the target property. This adjustment is guided by factors such as location, size, age, and unique features, ensuring the final predicted price is tailored to the target property. This approach provides a fast, reliable, and automated method for running comps and predicting property values.

Our model will initially be trained on a dataset of approximately 8,000 properties collected using the unofficial Zillow API via RapidAPI. We will establish a baseline with a simple regression model using structured data without images. This baseline will be measured using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). As we expand our dataset and integrate multimodal inputs, including property images, we will continuously compare our model's performance against these baseline metrics to validate its effectiveness as we build our system.
